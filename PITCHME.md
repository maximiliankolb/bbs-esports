## introduction
---
### esport is competitive gaming
---
* competing with the same preconditions
* team sport with different roles
* skill-based online multiplayer games
* fast-paced
---
* play
* watch
* stream
* compete
---
* nicknames
* sponsors, merch, and prize pools
* horrible graphics by choice
* fantastic balance
---
## example: counter-strike global offensive
---
* 5 ts vs 5 cts
* round-based fps; crosshair placement
* seven active maps with fixed starting areas (spawn-based roles)
---
* ts objectives: destroy target by planting bomb (at the a or b spot) and defending against attackers
* cts objectives: protect targets from being blown up; defuse; survive
---
* buy armor, weapons, and utilities
* making money from round wins, kills, plants, and defuses
* building up your economy
* 30 sec timeouts
---
### easy to learn, difficult to master
---
## structure of esport
---
* no global organization like fifa
* national and international leagues
* sponsored events
* independent platforms
* invite-only tournaments
---
* majors vs minors
* mostly male european players
* EU > NA
* mostly fans of the game, not the team
---
## example: astralis
---
* professional danish team
* player-owned organization
* 5 players; coach; sport psychologist; manager
---
## the future and the beauty of esports
---
* growth inside and outside its traditional market
* lasting professionalization
* mayor traditional teams investing in esports
* interesting area for digital and traditional companies like intel or audi
---
* amazon bought twitch for $1bn
---
* ability to compete on different levels
* highly tactical approach nowadays, less pure skill
---
## my personal experience
---
* started playing as a hobby
* joined amateur clan
* played badly and inconsistently
---
* changed to become a spectator
* visited esl one cologne in july 2017
---
